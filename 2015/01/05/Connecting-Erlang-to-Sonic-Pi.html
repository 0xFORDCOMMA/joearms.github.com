	    <h1> Connecting Erlang to the SonicPi </h1>
	      <p>Last September after giving <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4'>my keynote at StrangeLoop</a> I bumped into my
old friend <a href='https://twitter.com/@samaaron'>Sam Aaron</a>. As usual he was bubbling over with enthusiasm,
he'd been making a music program for kids <a href='http://sonic-pi.net/'>Sonic Pi</a> which interested
me.
</p>
<p>I'm interested in all things musical and especially making noises with computers
so I was _very_ interested in Sonic Pi.
</p>
<p>My first thought was &ldquo;how can I control Sonic Pi from Erlang?&rdquo; --
with Sam at hand this turned out to be really really easy.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;All you have to do,&rdquo; said Sam &ldquo;is open UDP port 4557 and send it
an OSC message.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What message?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>
<p><span class='code'>"\run code $string"</span> said Sam. Where <span class='code'>$string</span> is whatever you would
have typed into the Sonic Pi control window.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's easy,&rdquo; I thought, and it was. All I needed was a library to
convert Erlang terms to OSC messages. After a little searching I found
a library at <a href='https://github.com/mujaheed/erlang-osc'>erlang-osc</a>.
</p>
<p>The rest was easy.
</p>
<p>I'd completely forgotten about this until earlier today when
<a href='https://twitter.com/@WadeMealing'>@WadeMeadling</a> tweeted me asking if the code was documented
anywhere. Well it wasn't and now it is.
</p>
<p>I've put the code up at <a href='https://github.com/joearms/sonic_pi_interface'>sonic_pi_inteface</a> it's been tested with sonic
Pi version 2.0 and seems to work.
</p>
<p># On the Sonic Pi Interface
</p>
<p>I'd now like to take a moment and heap praises upon the design of
Sonic Pi. It literally took me about ten minutes to interface Erlang to Sonic Pi.
</p>
<p><span class='emph'>Actually this is not quite true</span> It took me ten minutes after Sam
had explained how the interface worked - he had not documented the
interface, assuming that nobody would wish to remotely control the
program.
</p>
<p>The interface is simplicity itself. Open a UDP port (in this case port
4557) and send it a fragment of Ruby (as an OSC message). Would that
all programs were that easy to interface.
</p>
<p>I have had the misfortune to interface Erlang to the Apple Core-audio and Core-midi
interfaces - now this (interfacing to Core-audio) is not for the faint hearted.
</p>
<p>Applications using core audio must be liked in memory to the core audio framework,
a practice which is bizarre and which makes interfacing to languages that do not
have the memory layout conventions of objective-C a pain.
</p>
<p>This (the interfacing) harks back to the old arguments of &ldquo;shared
memory&rdquo; verses &ldquo;message passing&rdquo; concurrency. Linking things in
memory and using callbacks is painfully difficult and highly error
prone.
</p>
<p>This practise (shared memory) comes from the days when efficiency
_was_ a problem, when we had computers with MHz clocks and tens of
KBytes of memory. Those days are long gone.
</p>
<p>Using a message passing, interfacing to Sonic Pi was pure joy. Open a
port, send it a message, done.  Easy.
</p>
<p>If I were defining an audio API I'd be able to say:
</p>
<div class='pre'>piano ! {play_note, C}
</div>
<p>From my favorite programming language (Erlang) and it would just work.
