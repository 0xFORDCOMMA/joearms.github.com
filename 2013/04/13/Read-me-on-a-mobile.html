	    <h1> Read me on a mobile </h1>
	      <p>I've now changed my blog so you can read it on a mobile.
</p>
<p>I tried to read the blog on my Android phone, and the result was crap,
so I've redone the style-sheets and used some twitter bootstrap magic
so now you can read the blog on a mobile.
</p>
<p>The banner needs some work on it (when viewed on a mobile) but
otherwise I'm happy with the results.
</p>
<p>All I have to do (at home) is point the browser on my Android phone at
<a href='http://192.168.0.21:4000<'>http://192.168.0.21:4000<</a> and Jekyll, running on my
laptop (which has IP 192.168.0.21) serves up the page.
</p>
<a name='head_1'></a><h1>Thanks Tom</h1>
<p>The blog is powered by <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a> and the more I use it the more I like
it. It only took a few hours of mucking around to make a responsive
design that worked on my laptop and on my phone.
</p>
<p>I'd bumped into Tom Preston Warner at several Erlang conferences and
we kind of clicked. So I mailed him a little thank you. <span class='emph'>There's
nothing like a little unsolicited thank you message, to cheer your day
up</span> so I sent this:
</p>
<div class='pre'>    From: Joe Armstrong <erlang@gmail.com>
    To: tom@github.com

    Hi Tom,

    I just started using Jeykll - it's brilliant - the bits fit together
    beautifully.

    It makes blogging so easy. Thanks for this, it's great.

    If you have performance problems, we can rewrite it in erlang :-)

    Cheers

    /Joe

    To: Joe Armstrong <erlang@gmail.com>

    Hi Joe,

    Wow, that's so awesome you're using Jekyll to blog now! It's really
    great to see a simple side project turn into something that people
    love to use. As a huge Erlang fan, you have no idea how happy this
    makes me. =)

    Tom

<p>A win-win situation. <a href='http://www.infoq.com/interviews/erlang-and-github'>Github uses Erlang</a>, and I get to use github,
great.	  
</p>
<a name='head_2'></a><h1>The new blog</h1>
<p>I decided to do a couple of things. The guys at Pragmatic have always
said that I should advertise my book, but I'd never actually
bothered. When the first edition came out I sent one mail to the
Erlang mailing list and the next day a few hundred people bought the
PDF version of book and so I thought &ldquo;the Erlang mailing list is a
pretty good advertising channel.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>I have long labored under the belief that if you did something good
that the world would come knocking at you door. So you do the stuff,
send one mail to the Erlang mailing list and wait. If stuff is good
folks will find it.
</p>
<p>I discussed this at length in <a href='http://joearms.github.io/2013/03/27/promoting-erlang.html'>Promoting Erlang</a>.
</p>
<p>Now I've added adverts to my book on the front page and a link to my
thesis which is a free download.
</p>
<p>As time goes on I'll be adding information to <a href='http://joearms.github.io/resources.html'>Resources</a>. At the moment
it's just a placeholder.
</p>
<a name='head_3'></a><h1>Thanks for the edits</h1>
<p>When I was in school I was a total loser at English. I couldn't spell
for toffee, hadn't a clue about punctuation. I can spell and punctuate
way better now, but I'm still a long way from perfect. I tend to see
what I thought I had written not what I actually wrote, so all your
edits are greatly appreciated.
</p>
<p>Ten guys have corrected my typos, or otherwise fixed errors in my
Blog. So ten minutes after I publish a blog, I get pull requests on
github. So far I've had help from:
</p>
<li>Alvaro Videla (Switzerland), </li>
<li>Sylvain Benner (Canada),</li>
<li>Agis Anastasopoulos (Greece), </li>
<li>Ivan Uemlianin (UK),</li>
<li>Daniel Luna (USA),</li>
<li>Csaba Hoch (Hungary), </li>
<li>Juanito Fatas (Taiwan), </li>
<li>Chad DePue (Argentina),</li>
<li>Lian Cheng (China) and </li>
<li>Catlion (Unknown). </li>
<p>10 people from as many different countries. While politicians and
power-mongers f\*\*k the  world up, we, programmers and engineers
get on with the job, collaborating and helping each other, which gives
me some hope for the future.
</p>
<p>Thanks, guys, I really appreciate this.
