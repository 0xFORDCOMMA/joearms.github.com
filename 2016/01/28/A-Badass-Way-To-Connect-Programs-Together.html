<p><a href='http://opensoundcontrol.org'>Open Sound Control</a> is a binary
protocol for exchanging data between machines.
</p>
<blockquote><b>Open Sound Control</b> is just about <span style='color:red'>the
worse possible name</span> for a protocol since I'd thought for a long
time that this protocol could only be used to control sounds.  Nothing
is further from the truth. <span style='color:red'>OSC should be
renamed OAC -- Open <b>Anything Control</b></span> - which would be a far
better name since it can be used to control *anything*
</blockquote>
<p>OSC-over-UDP is just OSC packed data sent over a UDP connection.
My first serious encounter with OSC-over-UDP was when I
attended strangloop and talked about <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4'>The Mess We're In</a>
</p>
<p>I bumped into Sam Aaron, the unstoppable force behind <a href='http://sonic-pi.net/'>Sonic Pi</a> and
said that it would be really cool to control Sonic Pi from Erlang.
...
</p>
<p>Sam told me that to control <span class='code'>Sonic Pi</span> all I had to do was send it OSC
encoded messages over UDP.
</p>
<p>I was first rather skeptical to using OSC-over-UDP but have rapidly
came to believe that this is a really-really good way to proceed. My
initial dislike of OSC-over-UDP was colored by my JSON-over-TCP
experience. TCP is session based which make life easy (for some of us)
and JSON is popular. On the other hand UDP can suffer from packet loss
and OSC is an obscure protocol - <b>digging deeper I found myself being
more and more attracted to OSC-over-UDP</b>.
</p>
<a name='head_2'></a><h1>Why do I like OSC-over-UDP?</h1>
<p>To start with OSC is beautiful and what I call &ldquo;simple by design&rdquo; -
more on this later. A complete OSC encoder is tiny and can be written
in any decent language in a few pages of code.  My (incomplete)
implementation <a href='https://github.com/joearms/music_experiments/blob/master/osc.erl'>osc.erl</a> is tiny.  It's trivial to implement and
extremely efficient. JSON on the other hand is not so easy to
implement.
</p>
<p>I've always been attracted to things that are simple and powerful.
Simplicity means they can be implemented in few lines of code.  Fewer
lines of code mean less possibility of errors and less to maintain.
</p>
<p>Session based TCP programs are trivial to write in Erlang but a bugger
in any sequential language. TCP uses the idea a session and the only
rational way to program a session is as a process or (horrors) as a
thread.
</p>
<blockquote>In Erlang session management is easier than falling off a log - one
session equals one controlling process and as many sub-processes as you
feel like.
</blockquote>
<p>In most other languages session management involves
mutable state concurrency. A program that is a dozen lines of Erlang
escalates into a mess of locks and mutexes or callbacks which in most
languages is a thin layer over a pthreads implementation.
</p>
<p>For those of you who haven't written a multi-threaded TCP socket
server in C using pthreads I can only say &ldquo;don't go there, it's not a
pleasant experience&rdquo; I've been there done that, and have the grey
hairs to prove it.
</p>
<p>UDP is a lot simpler than TCP and is far easier to use
in sequential languages. There are no sessions in UDP only messages.
Servers don't have to be multi-threaded to support sessions but
can be interrupt driven and run in a single thread. This is wonderful
news for systems like Node.js whose concurrency model is non-existent
and whose idea of having a fun time is throwing promises into the
future and hoping that nobody breaks them.
</p>
<p>Well as anybody who has watched Casablanca knows promises can be
broken.
</p>
<p>For many years I've been saying that it would be nice to collaborate
by sending message to each other and not by grocking around in each
other's messes. I basically don't want to know how you've implemented
your pile of shit, I just want to send it message to tell it what to
do. I'd naively assumed that something like Anything-over-TCP would be
fine and easy to implement, so I made a system called <a href='http://ubf.github.io/ub'>UBF</a> which is a
layered on top of TCP and hoped that everybody would use it.
</p>
<blockquote>I guess I'd underestimated the difficulty of implementing 
Anything-over-TCP in a sequential language. Just because it's really really
easy in Erlang doesn't mean to say it's easy in sequential languages.
</blockquote>
<p>TCP sessions map 1:1 onto Erlang programs and the programs are trivial.
But in a sequential language they map N:1 onto a single process, which is
a pain in the butt.
</p>
<p>For easy of implementation nothing I know of beats OSC-over-UDP - it's
really easy.
</p>
<p>My first experience with this was at the Strangeloop conference in St
Louis in 2014 - I bumped into Sam Aaron and we got talking. I asked
him if I could remote control the Sonic Pi - and he said "sure just
send it some OSC messages" we sat down, I Googled a bit and found an
OSC library for Erlang and ten minutes later we were collaborating.
</p>
<p>I could collaborate with him by sending him OSC messages over UDP and
didn't have to understand one iota of how his application was built
and structured. It didn't matter all I had to do was understand
the messaging protocol.	  
</p>
<p>Time passed and I'd almost forgot ot this - but the other day I
started wondering how to make sounds - I'd done this in <a href='http://joearms.github.io/2016/01/06/fun_with_swift_and_midi.html'>Fun with Swift
and Midi</a> and wondered idly how the Sonic Pi did this.
</p>
<p>I though to myself &ldquo;I know what I'll do, I'll build the Sonic Pi from
the sources and in doing so get to understand how the sound generating
works.&rdquo; Well as we all know building from the sources is not easy.
<span style='color:red'>I tried and failed</span> and tweeted
</p>
<p><img src='/images/blessed_tweet.png'>
</p>
<p>I'm now at an impasse - I'm mailed some guys on the Sonic Pi list who
have what we think to be an identical setup - only the build works for
them and not for me. Does that sound familiar? You bet your sweet
lives it does. And why does it work for them and not for me?  Answer:
Because the initial state of our machines is different and we have
know way of describing what the initial state is.
</p>
<p>A little more digging in the Sonic Pi code revealed that it was really
the SuperCollider <span class='code'>scsynth</span> program that was making the noises and that
this talked to the Sonic Pi by sending OSC-over-UDP messages - I
wonder where Sam Arron got this idea from.
</p>
<a name='head_3'></a><h1>Time to learn the SuperCollider and trace the OSC messages</h1>
<p>Sam helped me trace the OSC messages to the SuperCollider and after a
few hours hacking I could send messages to <span class='code'>sysnth</span> with OSC-over-UDP
messaging. Now I can build my project without having to build nor
understand that internal structure of the <span class='code'>scsynth</span> or even the Sonic
Pi.
</p>
<p>Sam wants to add a few features to the Sonic Pi and we'll try and do
this with an OSC-over-UDP component written in Erlang. If this works
it will show that we can collaborate without messing with each others
code.
</p>
<p>All of this made me realize that the conventional way of collaboration
is to mess with each others code, simply because it's technically
rather complicated to build session based servers using
Anything-over-TCP semantics so the way we collaborate is an
unintentional consequence of a bad (or nonexistent) concurrency model.
</p>
<p>Now I'm quite excited - the SuperCollider, Sonic Pi and Pure Data are
all insanely great projects - if we can get them all talking together
through communication channels when we can make a new way of
interworking not based on the silly idea of performing open brain
surgery on other peoples code.
</p>
<p>We can send messages to things and ask them to do things.
</p>
<blockquote>Sending message to things to get them do do things is the *central*
idea in OO programming - As <a href='http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlanKayOnMessaging)'>Alan Kay wrote</a>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/kay_quote.png">
</p>
<p>Pity nobody does this properly for purely local applications. 
</p>
<p>I've always thought that people should be allowed to program in their
favorite programming language - if they like Badtran-7 they they
should program in Badtran-7 but If want to collaborate with them I
should not be forced to program in Badtran-7.
</p>
<p>I like to write my code in Erlang so to collaborate I'll write my code in
Erlang you write your code in Badtran-7 and we'll communicate in
Anything-over-Whatnot. For ease of implementation OSC-over-UDP looks
really good.
</p>
<a name='head_4'></a><h1>So what's so good about OSC?</h1>
<p>To explain why I like OSC I'll first back off and talk about
Tag-Length-Value encodings.
</p>
<p><b>Tag-Length-Value</b> (TLV) encodings are used to 
describe data structures in packets that can be send &ldquo;on
the wire&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>TLV data structures are simple and look like this:
</p>
<div class='pre'>+-----+--------+-------+
| Tag | Length | Value |
+-----+--------+-------+
</div>
<p><span class='code'>Tag</span> says what the type of the data which follows is, <span class='code'>Length</span> is the size of
the data and <span class='code'>Value</span> the data itself.
</p>
<p>One slight problem with TLV encodings is alignment. If we're sending
4 byte integers or 8 byte IEEE floats we'd want the items to be
aligned on 4 byte boundaries.
</p>
<p>For languages that don't care about word alignment (like Erlang, Smalltalk, and a few
others) byte aligned TLVs are efficient and extremely easy to implement.
</p>
<p>For word aligned languages, we want to align on word boundaries.
</p>
<p>The OSC protocol (Open Sound Control) protocol takes a different
approach. It it's <span class='code'>Verb-Tag*-Value*</span> encoded.
</p>
<p>First comes a <span class='code'>Verb</span> which is a zero terminated string padded to a four byte boundary.
Then comments a sequence of tags (which is also encoded as a string)
then a sequence of values - each value corresponds to a single tag.
</p>
<p>The tags are <span class='code'>i</span> for an integer <span class='code'>d</span> for a double <span class='code'>s</span> for a string and so on.
</p>
<p>So the tag string <span class='code'>iisif</span> means that the values in the packet
are <span class='code'>int32</span> <span class='code'>int32</span> <span class='code'>string</span> <span class='code'>int32</span> <span class='code'>float</span> in that order. Both the
encoder and decoder know how these data types are encoded
so no additional information is necessary.
</p>
<p>The tag string also suffices as a <span class='code'>type descriptor</span> that accurately describes
the type of the data in the message - *yes OSC is strongly typed*.
</p>
<a name='head_5'></a><h1>Simplicity by Design</h1>
<p>The interesting thing about OSC encoding is that:
</p>
<li>It is extremely efficient.</li>
<li>encoders/decoders can be implemented in a few lines of code.</li>
<li>It is strongly typed.</li>
<li>Complex nested data structures cannot be represented.</li>
<p>The last point is interesting - it means that we'll have to restrict our messages
to flat data structure built from simple things like integers and strings.
</p>
<p>To my mind this is a good thing - <b>this is simplicity by design</b>. Most
applications that I have seen do not require deeply nested complex
data structures in the communication protocols - and if they use such
data structures they've probably been designed by a committee (and yes
3GPP I'm looking at you :-).
</p>
<blockquote>Let's compare this to JSON - JSON is flexible, untyped, tricky to
parse and represent and wasteful of space &ldquo;on the wire&ldquo;. In other
words JSON has everything that a wire line protocol should not have.
</blockquote>
<a name='head_6'></a><h1>Why binary protocols are important</h1>
<p>2014 was the tipping point, where more people access the Internet
though mobile terminals (phones) than wire-line terminals (fixed
computers). For mobile data, every bit counts. The radio spectrum is
a limited resource. Within a given mobile cell the total bandwidth
available is a finite and fixed amount, and this must be divided by
the number of device in the cell that are simultaneously
communicating. This is why everything slows down in peak periods when
everybody is connected up at the same time.
</p>
<p>It is therefore essential not to waste bandwidth - I think it is
totally crazy to send JSON or XML &ldquo;over the air&rdquo; since this will
degrade the performance of the applications giving a bad user
experience and higher bills - since ultimately we pay for every bit of
data.
</p>
<p>Even in fiber nets we pay one way or another - here the costs are in
terms of energy - it uses more energy to encode/decode verbose data
structures than well designed ones.
</p>
<p>In the Telcomms Industry there's been a great deal of effort to minimize
the overheads in communication protocols - ASN.1 sweats blood to save
bits - which are then wasted by programmers sending JSON down the
wire.
</p>
<p>Not only does JSON/XML on the wire waste energy, and costs more - the
user experience in a congested net is degraded - applications that
minimize net bandwidth will there be more attractive in a congested net
than applications that waste bandwidth.	  
</p>
<p>When writing a distributed application where the
components send messages to each other, you'd better know
well in advance exactly what messages you're going to send and receive
and what their types are.
</p>
<blockquote>OSC messages with type signatures seems to be the perfect balance
between power and expressiveness.
</blockquote>
<p>They are expressive - but not too expressive (limiting the types to flat
sequences of atomic types) seems a good idea - it certainly gets the
job done and are &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; for most purposes.
</p>
<p>If a protocol cannot be expressed in sequences of OSC messages it
probably should not be used.
</p>
<p>Finding an appropriate level for encoding messages is difficult.
</p>
<p>At a low level of abstractions we could just send integers over the
wire but this would be too low level. At a higher level we could use
some form of S-expression (like XML or JSON, which are just verbose
S-expressions) but this is *too* expressive.
</p>
<p>OSC seems to strike the right balance.
</p>
<p>OSC has an additional advantage - the internal representation of an OSC
message in the programming language of your choice is easy - why is
this? Precisely because OSC does not have deeply nested recursive data
structures.
</p>
<p>If you parse XML or JSON you need to map the parse tree onto some
object structure in your language, and since the parse trees in complex,
the object in your programming language will be complex.
</p>
<p>The intrinsically flat structure of OSC is attractive, since not only
the protocols are simple, but the code to handle then will have a
simple flat structure - again simplicity by design rather than
accident.
</p>
<p>We could also stick OSC messages in files, which would be easy to
parse and again have the balance of expressiveness contra simplicity.
</p>
<blockquote>One measure of how good a protocol is is the size of the implementation
and the time it took to write it. As I said implementing OSC
is really easy, thanks mainly to the simplicity of the design.
</blockquote>
<p>I've written a number of XML parsers in my time, and it is not easy
and there are some unpleasant edge cases. JSON parsers are also cumbersome beasts.
</p>
<p>To see just exactly how easy this is I've made a lttle GitHub procject
where to test these ideas. The (incomplete) OSC encoder is in <a href='https://github.com/joearms/music_experiments/blob/master/osc.erl'>osc.erl</a>.
</p>
<p>The library is being used to connect to three diffent programs and is
described in <a href='http://joearms.github.io/2016/01/29/Controlling-Sound-with-OSC-Messages.html'>Controlling Sound With OSC Messages</a>.
