	    <h1> New Blogging Software </h1>
	      <p>I finally did it and rewrote all my blogging software.
</p>
<p>In an earlier post I claimed that <a href='http://joearms.github.io/2013/03/28/jekyll-is-great.html'>Jekyll is great</a> well it was great
until somebody at GitHub decide to improve Jekyll and <b>change</b> the
backend rendering engine.
</p>
<p>I was <b>very annoyed about this</b> - my old blogs have semi-permanent
URLs addresses. So or example the &ldquo;Jekyll is great&rdquo; posting has a
URL <span class='code'>http://joearms.github.io/2013/03/28/jekyll-is-great.html</span>.
</p>
<p>The sudden change that GitHub made without warning destroyed some of
the formatting of previous existing pages.
</p>
<p>I posted a brief article <a href='http://joearms.github.io/2016/03/21/Why-Markdown-Sucks.html'>Why Markdown Sucks</a> and hoped the problem would go away.
</p>
<p>A few helpful people mailed me and said I could edit my <span class='code'>_yaml</span> file
and and some weird crap to it that would make the problem go away, but
I didn't like the idea of this.
</p>
<blockquote>By my way of thinking, once OI have published an article and got all
  the typos out, then that article should stay the same <b>forever</b>
  or at least until the sun turns into a red giant, whichever is the
  sooner.
</blockquote>
<p>If the GitHub people cannot be trusted not to mess up my site without
my permission, then the system becomes rapidly unusable.
</p>
<a name='head_1'></a><h1>We're really destroying history</h1>
<p>In the longer term, changing the content of something once published
is falsifying history.
</p>
<p>Suppose I was to drop dead tomorrow, people might visit old pages that
I've created, find typographic errors and think &ldquo;this is a sloppy
mess, I won't read it.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The Jekyll publish process had an implicit promise. &ldquo;If you create a
markdown file with the right magic commands in it, I'll turn this into
nicely formatted HTML.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Well they broke that promise - so Jekyll became unusable for me.
</p>
<p>What were the alternatives - I could have used &ldquo;somebody elses
formatting program&rdquo; - something like <a href='https://gohugo.io'>Hugo</a> but then I's have to make
sure that Hugo still worked in the future, so I'd need all the source
code for Hugo.
</p>
<p>I could run Jekyll locally and upload the generated HTML to GitHub,
but I've noticed that even my local Jekyll tends to get bit-rot with
time and has on several precious occasions just stopped working.
</p>
<blockquote>I decided to take the easy way out. Write my own static site
 generator. Moreover I would use no external dependencies.
</blockquote>
<p>That way I could make the inputs and outputs <b>exactly what I wanted</b>.
</p>
<a name='head_2'></a><h1>How do I generate web pages?</h1>
<p>The input to my blogging software as an org-mode file. I use the
<a href='http://orgmode.org'>emacs orgmode</a> for editing my blog entries.
</p>
<p>The individual entries are written in &ldquo;markdown'ish&rdquo; style.
</p>
<p>Since I want some kind of macro/template expansion mechanism I allow
&ldquo;embedded Erlang&rdquo; in the input. Erlang expressions are written
<span class='code'>&lt;? ... ?></span> and the code generator evaluates the expressions inside
the decorated parentheses and pastes them into the document.
</p>
<p>The template expander  is thus a fully-fledged programming language
and not some ad-hock tempting language with dubious semantics.
</p>
<p>Since I wanted to view my web pages, I added a little web server, so I
can see the results of my efforts.
</p>
<a name='head_3'></a><h1>Fixes to GitHub</h1>
<p>Migrating away from Jekyll was easier than I expected, though not what
I expected. I Googled a bit and found that I had to make a file called
<span class='code'>.nojekll</span> and I had to checkout a branch called <span class='code'>gh-pages</span>.
</p>
<p>I did this and things didn't work as I'd expected. A bit more Googling
suggest that I wait a bit and after half an hour or so things started
working again.
</p>
<p>Exactly how and where Jekyll puts things is still a mystery to me.
</p>
<p>The only problem I had was retaining the old URLs - I wanted
identical URLs to the last version of the blog. This is so that the
Disque comments that people had added to the blog entries were
retained.
</p>
<p>The code for all of this is in
https://github.com/joearms/joearms.github.com/tree/master/_src.
</p>
<p>If you peep at the code be warned - it is undocumented and not of
publication quality.
</p>
<a name='head_4'></a><h1>Are you crazy - no dependencies at all?</h1>
<p>Perhaps I am crazy, but every time I've included somebody elses code
it has turned round and hit me in the face a few years later.
</p>
<p>Code gets changed in non-backwards compatible ways - I  like
to always take the latest version of a dependency (since I guess the
author is uninterested in maintaining older versions).
</p>
<p>The problem with this is that future releases of a dependency might
break my code and I don't want to be bothered with fixing it.
</p>
<p>I guess I could take a static copy of the entire dependency and just
dump it into my directory structure - but then I'd be responsible for
fixing it if it were to break and also I don't; really like including
dozens and dozens of modules that I don't understand, in place of two
of three modules that I've written myself and do understand.
</p>
<p>This is why I wrote my own little web server and template engine - the
web sever is only a could of small modules and easy to understand.
</p>
<p>Better to have something small that does the job and which you
completely understand than something large which looks on the surface
to be far better but which you do not completely understand.
