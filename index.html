<p>This blog is being rearranged to remove all dependencies upon Jekyll.</p>

<p>Since Github changed the backend rendering of my blog *without notice* destroying
all my formatting I have decided to generate *everything* off line with my own program.</p>

<p>This file is index.html at the top of my directory heirearchy in the master branch</p>

<p><a href="_site/">The mucked up blogs are here</a> --- but something is still wrong
so you can't read them. Don't tell me - I know.</p>
