    <h1>Why did I wake up just before my alarm clock went off?</h1>

  <div id="content">
    <p>I often think that I wake up just before my alarm goes off.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago I lay in bed thinking <code class="highlighter-rouge">the
alarm is just about to go off'' and then a second later it did go off and I
thought</code>how come I woke up just before the alarm went off?’’
In the past I’d thought to myself ``I’ve got a super-accurate
timer in my head that wakes me up …’’ but then a new thought hit me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My brain is a distributed computer. When the alarm goes off
various parts of my brain which are in deep-sleep mode need waking
up - what I’m observing is a timing error in my brain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully a neurophysiologist who is reading this article will add a
comment to tell me that I’m totally wrong and point me to some
literature that explains what happens when I wake up.</p>

<h1 id="i-wake-up-just-before-the-alarm-went-off">I wake up just before the alarm went off</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>I didn’t wake up before the alarm went off - I woke up <strong>because</strong>
the alarm went off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So How come I thought I woke up before the alarm went off?</p>

<h1 id="so-who-actually-woke-up-first">So who actually woke up first?</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">I'' in the phrase</code>I woke up’’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The I in question is my conscious brain, I guess this is the
cerebral cortex.  The bit of my brain that first registers the
alarm is something more primitive - possible the amygdala.</p>

<p>I’m speculating that what happens is something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The alarm goes off</li>
  <li>The amygdala registers this fact and sends emergency wake-up signals to other parts of the brain</li>
  <li>The cerebral cortex is in deep sleep mode and needs to be re-booted</li>
  <li>different parts of my brain are booting at different speeds and sending status reports to the cerebral cortex.</li>
  <li>The  cerebral cortex has finished its boot sequence - I’m now awake (conscious) - so I can think a bit (and here’s the kicker) the cerebral cortex has not  yet received a sound alarm signal, so although I’m awake and thinking my brain does not yet know why it has woken up.</li>
  <li>The amygdala sends the ring signal to the auditory cortex for processing</li>
  <li>The auditory cortex processes the sound signal and figures out that in means the alarm clock is ringing and sends a message to the cerebral cortex</li>
</ul>

<p>We can illustrate this in a message sequence diagram (this is
something computer scientists like to draw in order to understand
what’s going on):</p>

<p><img src="/images/wake1.png" /></p>

<p>Time flows down the diagram and the different activities are show in different colors.
I’m assuming the brain is like a computer. Parts of the brain are sleeping (blue) booting 
(pink) processing (red) or available to perform computations (green).</p>

<p>The conscious ``me’’’ thinks (in time order):</p>

<ul>
  <li>1) I’m awake.</li>
  <li>2) The alarm has just gone off.</li>
  <li>3) That’s funny how come I woke up before the alarm went off?</li>
  <li>4) Perhaps I’ve got a super accurate clock in my head that wakes me up before the alarm goes off.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-22281,00.html">I regularly wake up moments before my alarm clock rings, no matter
what time I set it for. Does this mean I have supernatural
powers?</a>
this phenomena was discussed in some detail. Interestingly none of the
explanations was anywhere near what I’m suggesting.</p>

<p>Occam’s razor would imply that the simplest answer to why you woke up
before the alarm went is ``you didn’t, you woke up because the alarm
went, and your brain got it wrong.’’</p>

<h1 id="a-simpler-model">A simpler model</h1>

<p>The brain behaves like a distributed computer. It has several
processing units, different parts of the brain take different times to
process signals. The part of the brain where conscious thoughts are
processed (like <code class="highlighter-rouge">I'm awake'' and</code>the alarm went off’’) interprets
information coming from other parts of the brain, but this part of the
brain takes longer to work out what is happening than the parts of the
brain that supply it with information.  Sometimes we get things wrong
and have to adjust our view of reality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose now that:</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>time to wake up &lt; time to recognized the alarm signal
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then we get something like the following:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wake2.png" /></p>

<p>Now we don’t need to assume that parts of the brain are asleep and
need rebooting.  If the time to process the audio signal (the red box
marked B above) into a semantic signal (the alarm went off) is longer
than the time taken for the brain to wake up (red box A) then we will
think that we woke up <strong>before</strong> hearing the sound.</p>

<p>Since this the idea that we wake up <strong>before</strong> we hear the signal is
crazy we misinterpret what is going on and invent fancyfull and
incorrect explanations as to what has actually happened (like that we
after a super accurate clock in our brain that wakes us up just before
the alarm goes off).</p>

<h1 id="so-how-come-i-know-the-alarm-is-going-to-go-off">So how come I “know” the alarm is going to go off?</h1>

<p>The argument so far is that the alarm sends a signal that wakes my
conscious brain <strong>before</strong> the sound signal has been processed and sent
to the conscious brain. So how come I <code class="highlighter-rouge">know'' that the alarm is going
to go off? I suspect this is just the result of intelligent
guesswork. I</code>know’’ that the thing that wakes me up most mornings
<strong>is</strong> the alarm. So If I suddenly wake up it’s most likely because
the alarm just went off - the fact I haven’t yet ``heard’’ the alarm is
a result of a timing delay in the brain.</p>

<p>So the higher conscious part of the brain works like a Lamport clock
trying to order the events in a sequence that makes sense.</p>

<h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>

<p>I’m not really sure which parts of the brain do what. Do the parts of
the brain go to sleep?  Do they need rebooting? - How long does it
take to turn a sound waveform into a semantic ``alarm’’ signal. How
long does it take to reboot parts of the brain?</p>
